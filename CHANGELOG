3/3/2011 (OS):
* Changed python install behaviour
* Added Readme
* Added some basic documentation in CMakeLists.txt
* Added Python install targets

30/12/2010 (OS):
* Changed PMatrix to be a float matrix rather than double to save space
* Added setVerbose, getVerbose
* Moved peer into namespace PEER (have consistently, at least vbfa.XX)
* Added convergence tolerance level
* Sanitised debug messages

26-29/12/2010 (OS):
 * Added array_helper. This contains functions to convert from eigen matrices to C matrices and vice versa.
   This is used by the python swig wrappers and those to come for R
 * Added a default matrix type PMatrix, PVector (PeerMatrix...), this is just an alias but makes life easier
 * Added getters and setters for most things and moved variables to procted areas. THis is needed to have a consistent
   interface from python/R and C++
 * Added swig versions of the interfaces. WHen compiled with swig the setters/getters with Matrix objects disappear. 
   Note: this is neede, otherwise swig refuses fom appplying typemaps
 * Added build target "libpeer"
 * Added "python" directory. This contains a make file, "make" should be all it takes to generate the python wrapper
 * Added python_demo.py
